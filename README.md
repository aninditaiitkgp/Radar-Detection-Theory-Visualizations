# Radar-Detection-Theory-Visualizations
This repository contains MATLAB-based implementations for radar detection theory, focusing on visualization and analysis of:
1.Probability of Detection (Pd)
2.Probability of False Alarm (Pfa)
3.Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves
4.Gaussian probability density functions under different hypotheses
