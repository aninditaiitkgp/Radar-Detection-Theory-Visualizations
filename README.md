# Radar-Detection-Theory-Visualizations
This repository contains MATLAB-based implementations for radar detection theory, focusing on visualization and analysis of:
Probability of Detection (Pd), Probability of False Alarm (Pfa), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, Gaussian probability density functions under different hypotheses
